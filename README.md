# *CS 23-304 App to help implement Virginia CS standardsCS*
## *CodeVA*
## *Short Project Description:*
We are looking to develop an app to support school divisions in implementing the Virginia CS standards. In VA there is a mandate that CS be integrated for all students from kindergarten through 8th grade, and most school leaders are struggling with designing instructional programs to meet their students needs. This is not to develop lesson plans or classroom activities, but to do the back end design work that school leaders must do to ensure equitable access for all students.
